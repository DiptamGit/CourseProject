# About the project

### Installation Instructions!
To run the code in your local system you will need four things, assuming you already have git installed

  - Java 8
  - Maven 3+
  - Node js 12
  - Python 3

Installation instructions which I found helpful:
  - For Java you can use this [link](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/JDK_Howto.html), we used grallvm for dev use, but any jdk would work as long as its 8, please refrain from using 11, it may not run spring modules.
  - Node Js use this [link](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows)
  - Python 3, we used [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) distribution but technically any 3 distribution should work
  - Maven 3.6 is being used in this project but you can use any 3 above [version](https://www.baeldung.com/install-maven-on-windows-linux-mac) as well

Once you install and everything is setup, go your command prompt and check if they are in your path and setup was correct.
```sh
$ java -version
$ node -v
$ python â€“version
$ maven -v
```
If all of them responded correctly, please proceed to the next section
