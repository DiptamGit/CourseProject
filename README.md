Installation Instructions
To run the code in your local system you will need four things, assuming you already have git installed
Java 8 
Maven 3+
Node js 12
Python 3
I will give installation instructions which I found helpful
For Java you can use below link, I use grallvm for personal use, but any jdk would work as long as its 8, please refrain from using 11, it may not run my spring modules.

Node Js use below link

Python 3
I use Anaconda distribution but technically any 3 distribution should work
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/ 
I am using maven 3.6 but you can use any 3 above version as well

Once you install and everything is setup, go your command prompt and check if they are in your path and setup was correct.
Run Java -version
Node -v
Python â€“version
Maven -v
